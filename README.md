# chess-prediction

This project utilizes a large chess game dataset and supervised machine learning methods to predict which player will win a chess game given a board state, the ELO of both players, and the opening played. Furthermore, we explore how accurately this prediction is able to be made, comparing various different models including a least squares regression, a logistic regression, and a recurrent neural network. Finally, we analyze what features matter most in the scope of the problem, and hope to help players gain feedback before a chess game is over to analyze their own skill level.
